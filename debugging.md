This is showing me how much I have to learn of Javascirpt still. I'm grateful for chatgbt for showing me potential code, but also showing me what I still dont understand yet. So I'm going to try to learn alittl emore about javascript. I undesrtand the naming convention, but since I dont fully understand what I'm getting wrong, I'll need to have a refreshor on that.

Since I do debugging text for all my projects I figured I'd start here!

so I already have some things set up, I created a set sparkles which works! It doesn't have the effect I was hoping, but I got it so when it's turned on something happens. The problem I'm having with it is that the white circle that helpes the user to see when something is on or off like normal keeps appearing in the top left corner instead of within the button, so I have to debug that. Also for some reason recently the "sparkeles" are not where the cursor is, it's actually a few spots above that. So I'm going to figure out how to get it functional. 

I'm also working on the layout of the header. I got to to the point  there's now padding and color, but I dont think I like the title "Welcome to my Project" I think I'd rather have Tinkering Lab or something to that effect. I'll find some ideas later.

I also don't have all my projects within there yet, I only have two practice sites that I worked on. (one is a mathflashcard app based on penguins) and another is the pocatello chamber practiec I did one year. I think I should also have a timeline to showcase which year I did each project to show how i've grown. Once I'm working on the content then I'll add that. 

To do:

* fix where sparkles show when you move the cursor 
* fix the white circle that appears on the left corner of the page instead of in the button for the sparkle effects.  Have it default to off for accessibility purposes. 
* confirm you have an aria label to explain what the button does effectivly.
* change the "My projects" section to showcase a timeline. See if there may be creative ways to showcase it than just a simple list. 
* create a database where people can send feedback and the feedback will go into a postgress table that you can review messages. 
    * in the form for it have it so there's a button to say "I understand I'm opting out and will not receive any responses to this message" if they choose not to include email or phone number
