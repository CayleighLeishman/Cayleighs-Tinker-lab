                This project helped me strengthen my understanding of JavaScript—especially the dark mode/light mode toggle feature. 
                It was one of the most exciting things I learned that semester and really got me more into JavaScript.

                This project made me realize I still had a lot to learn. While I appreciated the chance to create a more colorful page, 
                I definitely humbled myself as I worked through properly implementing CSS and JavaScript.

              <p>
                This was a group project I worked on with classmates. We created a math flashcard app to help students practice math skills. 
                It was my first time using Svelte in a big project, and I learned a lot about components. I also learned the importance of 
                double-checking save files and not relying entirely on auto-save—lesson learned the hard way!

                This was my first time working with an API, and I was so excited to finally understand how they work. 
                I successfully connected the API and gained a clearer understanding of how MVC works and what APIs actually do.
